# Live-Action-Camp
This is a website dedicated to Live Action Role Players who would like a place to go and exercise their passion. The user gets to select different characters they would love to act out in one of the live action camps held during the year.

## The Process
This build was the most challenging in the course of the training. With this project i challenged myself and trid to work with aone to many and many to one model. The use of new model coupled with the use of the recentrly introduced Rails framework and SWL posed an exciting challenge. The 7 day period needed to complete the project seemed short, more planning helped me getoff to an easier start, I had notes on how to set up the  technologies but modelling and rendering were slightly challenging but given time can be summounted.

## Overview
A larp enthusiast signs into a page and is immediately able to see the roles that they sign up for during a camp. The nextpage allows the user to see the characters they already have in their profile. They can then add a new character, edit or delet the character from that page. The use of modals for all these actions allows the user to access all the functionalities within 2 clicks. To further help them plan for the camp the app includes a Weather API that alllows the user to tell what kind of clothing they should prepare for camp in advance.

## Version 2
In my second version I would love to be able to use devise to set up user authorization and cancancan for authentication. I would also love to show tribe attributes such as their insignia and colours as part of each character.
